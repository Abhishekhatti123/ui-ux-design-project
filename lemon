Create a Table Reservation Page
Defining the Problem
The Little Lemon Restaurant does not have an online reserve-a-table feature making it difficult for customers to reserve a table without having to call the restaurant directly. A mobile reservation page must be created that allows the user to choose the date, time, number of guests, and enter their contact information to create a seamless reservation experience.

Creating a Persona
A fictional person was created that would represent the sites target users. They were designed with a photo, name, bio, core needs, and frustrations simulating a real person. The persona was used as the basis of the sites design and direction as well as a way to place the designer in a users shoes and see how they would use and navigate the website
